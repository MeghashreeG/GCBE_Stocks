- Option 1: Lists the stocks available with the stock information such as market price.
- Option 2: Records a trade with respect either a buy or sell of a stock. 
- Option 3: This has two options performing operations on the stock information.

	-- Option 2: Calculates Share Index using the geometric mean of the Volume Weighted Stock Price for all stocks.
